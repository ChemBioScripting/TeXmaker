# TeXmaker
Fork of the [Official TeXmaker Source Code](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Qt toolkit (**version >= 5.7**) is required to compile this version (**5.0.3**) of TeXmaker, together with other packages. On  [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) distribution, for example, you will need of these packages, as described in the following videotutorial uploaded on [ChemBioScripting | YITA YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezPdWWrwIexD96fYNgO4pA):

* `gcc`
* `gcc-c++`
* `qt5`
* `qt5-devel`
* `poppler`
* `poppler-qt5`
* `poppler-qt5-devel`
* `ghostscript`

_<(embedded video - to be added)>_

The source-code can be compiled with `gcc`, `clang` and `msvc`.

> **Warnings** : all new code must have been tested before being proposed. Untested patches will be automatically rejected and all new features must follow the guide lines of the TeXmaker project :
>
> * Keep Texmaker easy to use with a clean and uncluttered interface;
> * Keep Texmaker being really and fully unicode;
> * Keep Texmaker being cross-platform.
